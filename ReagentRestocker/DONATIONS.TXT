Donation policy:

General rule of thumb: All donations basically go to supporting this addon in some way or another.

* All first donations go to Catyclism. I definitely want to upgrade and continue development on it when it comes out.
* After that, they basically go towards the WoW subscription and premium memberships at addon websites.
* Also, I have my eye on a WoW addon development book.

If everybody who downloads gives even a minimal amount of money to their favorite addons every month or so, that would be great and do a lot for the addon community.
